# Car-Game

Here i defined the game window size, car position and car movement variables.

I created a function to draw the car on the screen and created a function to handle the car movements.

I used a game loop to update the car position based on user input and redraw the car on the screen.

Specially added some additional features, such as obstacle detection, scoring and game over conditions.
